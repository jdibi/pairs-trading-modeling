# pairs-trading-modelling

The aim of this project is to model and simulate different pairs trading strategies, a statistical arbitrage approach that exploits temporary imbalances between two highly codependant assets.

The core of the project is based on modeling the spread (price difference between the two assets) using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, which captures the spread's mean reversion dynamics.
The study focuses on the distribution of key trading strategies metrics namely :

PnL (Profit & Loss)
sharpe Ratio, calmar ratio
Maxdrawdown

generated by different trading strategies.

## Objectif

Modeling the spread between two assets using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:

$$dX_t = \Theta(\mu  - X_t)dt + \sigma dW_t $$ 

Simulate the behavior of the spread under different parameter configurations.

Implement and compare two pairs trading strategies:

One based on the moving average of the spread and the other one based on the equilibrium average of the OU process.

Analyze the distribution of the strategies' PnL (returns, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.).

Study an real case scenario, where the parameters of the OU process change regime (detected via a Kalman filter).

## Spread modelling
The spread between two cointegrated assets is modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:
𝜇: equilibrium mean,
𝜃: speed of return to the mean,
𝜎: volatility of random noise.

Two possible regimes:
Regime 1: parameters ($\mu_1$, $\Theta_1$, $\sigma_1$)

Regime 2: parameters ($\mu_2$, $\Theta_2$, $\sigma_2$)

Regime changes are detected using a Kalman filter.

## Strategies

Strategy 1 — Sliding Mean Strategy

Calculation of the sliding mean of the spread over a window of 
ℎ days.

Position taken:

Sell (short) the spread if: $Spread_t > Mean_h + 2\sigma_h$

Buy (long) the spread if: $Spread_t < Mean_h - 2\sigma_h$

Close the position when the spread returns to its mean.

Two variants:

Allow transactions with negative PnL, Limit to transactions with positive PnL only.

Strategy 2 — Equilibrium Mean Strategy

Use the equilibrium mean of the OU process.

Position taking:

Long if the spread is below the equilibrium mean, Short if it is above.

Liquidation when the spread returns to its equilibrium mean.

Study of the case where the parameters change regime.


## Application case
Practical application on a pair of stocks selected according to cointegration criteria:

Cointegration test (Engle-Granger, Johansen).

Estimation of the spread and OU parameters.

Detection of regime change via Kalman filter.

Simulation and comparison of PnL for both strategies.

## Expected results

Empirical distribution of PnL (expectation, variance, skewness, kurtosis).

Comparison of performance between strategies and regimes:

Average PnL and volatility.

Sharpe ratio.

Trade success rate.

Impact of regime change on performance.
